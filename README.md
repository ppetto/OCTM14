This repository is a collection of material that I might use incorporating a collection of material that I will use for my presentation *Encouraging Computational Thinking in Probability and Statistics* at the 2014 Ohio Council of Teachers of Mathematics in Cleveland, November, 2014.

I appreciate any corrections or improvements to anything you find here. And translations of code to other useful computational languages.

Contact me at ppetto@ppetto.com â€“ thanks!
